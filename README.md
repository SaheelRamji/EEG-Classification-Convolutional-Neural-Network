Introduction:

This project focuses on developing a classification model for EEG data analysis, primarily targeting the differentiation of epileptic seizures. Utilizing the CHB-MIT EEG Database and the Bonn EEG Dataset, the project employs a comprehensive pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, feature extraction (including time-domain and frequency-domain features), data splitting for training, validation, and testing, model selection (considering Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)), and advanced training techniques to mitigate overfitting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized on the validation set, with hyperparameter fine-tuning aimed at optimizing model performance. This research aims to enhance medical diagnostics by leveraging machine learning methodologies to classify EEG data, particularly in epilepsy.
